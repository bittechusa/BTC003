Hello world! This is Tariq from New work, the most dumb QA/software tester world.


Hi Tariq bhai. Hope all is well with you. Guess what I just updated your file. 
I see you're perception about a QA/Software world is not very positive, however
I hope you're perception will change along the path about the QA's pple. They're not as dumb 
as you think
